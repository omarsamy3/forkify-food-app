# Forkify

Forkify is a web application that allows you to search for food recipes from various sources, view the ingredients and instructions, and save your favorite recipes in a personal list. You can also adjust the servings and get the updated quantities of ingredients. Forkify is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and uses the [Forkify API](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/) to fetch the recipes.
